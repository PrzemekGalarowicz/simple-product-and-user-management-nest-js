# Simple Product and User Management - Nest.js

I use a few concepts in the code. They may not be relevant in real-live apps, but they are used here to check them out.

So, don't judge me too much. :innocent:

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
